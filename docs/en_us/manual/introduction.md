# Feature Introduction

## Switch Account

This function only switches the last account currently logged in (accounts beyond the third one will be ignored).
After switching, you can continue adding tasks to run tasks with multiple accounts and configurations.

## Outside Deduction: The Series Of Dusks

The most useful roguelike mode for farming credits.

### Fast Mode

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. Before using the fast farming function, please fully level up `Engrave Growth - Song of Guidance（刻画生长-指引之歌）`.
> 2. Please set the difficulty level as high as possible to prevent insufficient scores leading to failure in farming tokens.
> 3. To adjust the difficulty, manually select the target difficulty level, go to the catalyst selection interface, and then exit.

### Normal Mode

> [!TIP]
>
> 1. Before use, you can pin (mark) four characters in your box to serve as the deployed characters.
> 2. It's recommended to include a healer in the team composition.
> 3. Please make sure that the last battle was in automatic combat before use. M9A cannot check whether it is in automatic combat.

> [!WARNING]
>
> 1. M9A does not handle the story, tutorials, etc., that appear only when playing the roguelike mode for the first time. You need to complete it manually once before using this function.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the complexity of this function's implementation, strange issues may occur. If possible, please enable screen recording on your emulator. When encountering problems, try to preserve sufficient information (all content under the `debug` and `logs` directories) so that developers can quickly locate and resolve the issue.

## Outside Deduction: The Syndrome Of Silence

> [!WARNING]
>
> 1. M9A does not process the gameplay instructions page that only appears when playing roguelike for the first time. Please manually progress to at least the second level before using it.
> 2. M9A cannot check if the game is in auto-battle mode. Please ensure that your most recent battle was in auto-battle mode before using it.

Based on testing, it is best to choose difficulty 2 or 3 for the mission. Difficulty 4 makes it easy to die in battle.
